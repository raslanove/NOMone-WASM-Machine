- Re-write header files so that the interfaces have atlernative class declarations to remove indirect jumps if C++ support is available.
- All create should be renamed into initialize (except NString).
- All createInHeap should be renamed to create.
- Remove all unnecessary interfaces and use "__" instead of ".". For example:
    instead of:
      NError.terminate();
    use:     
      NError__terminate();
      
      
      

For each index space, there are records:
========================================
ùêº ::= { types    (id)*,
       funcs    (id)*,
       tables   (id)*,
       mems     (id)*,
       globals  (id)*,
       locals   (id)*,
       labels   (id)*,
       typedefs functype* }
